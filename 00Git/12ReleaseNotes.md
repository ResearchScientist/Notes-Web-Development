# Release Notes

Docs detailing version changes.

These inform the reader about:

- what has changed
- why it was changed
- how the change affects the user
- what does the user need to do as a result of the change

# Content

Provide contact info within main body.

Each released note contains:

- version number
- app size
- release date

Format each note with sections that include:

- subheadings
- bulleted key items
- summary of each key item

Each section should have one label such as:

- new features - tips and tricks
- fixes - issues fixed
- improvements - speed , search
- additional resources - docs , vids , articles , images

These labeled sections can even be colour coded for ease of browsing. May want to include a legend.

Extra

- add a surprise gift for readers such as an animation , a sticker or joke

# Style

Consider who is reading the notes and why they are reading them.
Write as if talking to a non technical friend.

Use we and you. "You can now do this new neat thing"
