    <h2 class="title">Chapter Twelve: The Escape</h2>
    <p>Dear Diary,</p>
    <p>She was at it again today. I told her I didn't want to go. But as usual my pleas fell on deaf ears. I watched her as she meticulously gathered some items and set them on the kitchen table. One by one. She moved swiftly for a frail old lady. Or at least that's what she wants people to think. </p>
    
    <div class="tip tip-right">
        <p>Song playing in the background "If I could turn back time."</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>But she doesn't fool me. Those foster kids across the street don't trust her either.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
        <p>"Don't open the door!"</p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>I can hear her bones creaking as she starts to walk towards me. She's louder than the cries from the beaten wooden floor under that old rocking chair of hers.</p>
    <p>Does she seriously think I'm not going to fight.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
        <p>"I think she's dead"</p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>Suddenly the creaking stopped. What is she doing? Oh. She fell asleep. Why do they say 'fall asleep'. She didn't fall. She is just standing there, dreaming away.</p>
